Barnaby was a little bat with soft, fluffy fur and big, shiny eyes. He lived in a cozy little cave with his family. But Barnaby had a secret: unlike all the other bats, he was afraid of the big, dark night. Every evening, as the sun went down, the other bats would get excited. "Time for yummy moths!" they would chirp, and fly out into the cool air. But Barnaby would stay behind, hiding in the darkest corner of the cave, his little heart thumping like a drum.

One evening, as Barnaby was shivering in his corner, a tiny, blinking light danced into the cave. It zipped and zoomed, leaving a trail of sparkles in the air. The light landed softly on Barnaby's nose. It was a friendly firefly. "Hello!" he buzzed cheerfully. "My name is Flicker. Why are you hiding in here all alone?"

Before Barnaby could answer, a soft voice hooted from a branch just outside the cave. "Whoo-whoo is afraid of the quiet?" A large owl with kind, gentle eyes and fluffy, feathery eyebrows peeked in. "My name is Olivia," she said. "The dark isn't empty, little one. It's just waiting for you to listen."

Olivia blinked her big eyes. "Your ears are very special," she hooted gently. "They let you see with sound! All you have to do is make a little squeak." Barnaby was nervous, but he took a tiny breath and let out a small "Eeep!" The sound flew out and bounced right back. Suddenly, in his mind, he could see the shape of a little mushroom on the cave floor, as clear as day!

"Wow!" whispered Barnaby. His eyes popped open, full of wonder. "I can see! I can really see in the dark!" Flicker the firefly danced around his head. "I'll be your night-light!" he buzzed. "You'll never be alone." With his new friend Olivia watching and Flicker glowing beside him, Barnaby felt a flutter of courage in his chest. He flapped his wings, once, twice, and flew out of the cave and into the night!

The night air was cool on his fur. Barnaby squeaked again, a little louder this time. His sound-sight showed him a big, juicy moth fluttering nearby. With a happy swoop, he zipped through the air and caught it! The night wasn't a big, scary darkness anymore. It was a beautiful, sparkling adventure filled with friends and delicious snacks. And Barnaby the bat was finally ready to explore it all.
